    <h3><strong>This is a website where I will write about my favorite movies, games or activities that I have done or I
            want to done. I am really a boring person so there will be not much but making this website will be fun. I
            hope so. Also I am uploading it to github which is kinda new to me. But it will be fun.</strong>

        <p><b>Zodiac is a crime-thriller film based on a real story. I really love this movie, though I can't fully explain
            why. I hated it when it ended because I was completely absorbed in the story. It's one of those films that keeps you hooked from start to finish.</b>
